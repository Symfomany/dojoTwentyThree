## Permutation & Combinaisons (Niveau 4)

In this kata you have to create all permutations of an input string and remove duplicates, if present. This means, you have to shuffle all letters from the input in all possible orders.

```
    permutations('a'); // ['a']
    permutations('ab'); // ['ab', 'ba']
    permutations('aabb'); // ['aabb', 'abab', 'abba', 'baab', 'baba', 'bbaa']
```

## Detect Pangram (Niveau 6)

A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.

## Mexican Wave (Niveau 6)

The wave (known as the Mexican wave in the English-speaking world outside North America) is an example of metachronal rhythm achieved in a packed stadium when successive groups of spectators briefly stand, yell, and raise their arms. Immediately upon stretching to full height, the spectator returns to the usual seated position. The result is a wave of standing spectators that travels through the crowd, even though individual spectators never move away from their seats. In many large arenas the crowd is seated in a contiguous circuit all the way around the sport field, and so the wave is able to travel continuously around the arena; in discontiguous seating arrangements, the wave can instead reflect back and forth through the crowd. When the gap in seating is narrow, the wave can sometimes pass through it. Usually only one wave crest will be present at any given time in an arena, although simultaneous, counter-rotating waves have been produced. (Source Wikipedia)

wave("hello") => ["Hello", "hEllo", "heLlo", "helLo", "hellO"]

## Time Ago (Niveau 4)

Create a function with parameter timestamp (1530595979) and render ago string like:

```
    ago(1530595979) -> Il y a quelques instant
    ago(1530524979) -> Il y a 1 jour
    ago(1520524979) -> Il y a 3 mois
    ...
    ago(X) -> Il y a 1 an
```
